using 4000 training data
exp0:
hog feature
5 layers + final +softmax
adam learning rate 1e-3
no dropout or bn or reg
overfitting: train accuracy almost 100% and val caccuracy increasing but arounf 70%

exp1:
same as 1, add dropout after layers
validation acc increases but still overfitting

exp2:
add regulazrization 8e-3
dropout 0.3 on all layers
train:90% , validatiom 80%

exp3:
reg 5e-3
adam 1e-3
feature extraction
use augmented training data
dropout 0.2 after all layers
->validation accuracy reaches 97%, both train and validation imrove together
but best validation is saved when training accuracy is lower
(train was 95%)
train increases b3d keda l97 bas elvalidation flepoch dy mt7sntsh (Actually got worse)

exp4:
-using mariam's hog features
-same as experiment 3, regulrization 1e-2
-dropout 0.1
-plateaus at 84, but val accuracy is 97 when train is 70%


--best experiment:3
