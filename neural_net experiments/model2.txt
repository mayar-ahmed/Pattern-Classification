overfitting data -> true

exp0:
use 1000 data
rms prop learning rate 1e-3
overfitting: 99% accuracy and validation stopped at 93

exp1:
use 1000 data and add batch normalization, increase learning rate to 1e-2
converges fast bu val accuracy isa very low (stuck at 30s) while training is in 90s


exp2 :
remove batch normalization
learning rte 1e-3
dropout 0.1 after each layer
94%validation accuracy

exp3:
use new data (validation about 75 images)
--not run yet


--so far best accuracy is experiment2
