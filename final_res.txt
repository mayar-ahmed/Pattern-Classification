1- fc net not possible with 256*256, needs too many neurons
2-model.py
after shuffling data (1000) , rms prop with 1e-3 
validation accuracy 94.4% & train accuracy 98%

experiment 6,8,9,10 -> best accuracy , check their tensorboards
adding dropout removed overfitting but validation higher than training accuracy
not sure if that's correct

2- model2.py ->very slow and hugr overfitting
-first try 1000 then 2000
np dropout or anything
-doesn't reach higher accuracy than model 1 (unnecessary complexity)
