-discard the previous data
-open load_data script, give the function call the path which contains 
the folders of images, rename them to diamond,ellipse,line

-load data will read it, split into train, validation and save x_train, y_train in data folder

-data is shuffled and of size (N ,256,256) ,no need to do anything 

-if you need more training data, run augmentation script, it will increase training data size to 3000
and save xt_aug, yt_aug of size (N,256,256,1) in data folder

-validation data will stay as it is (classifier shouldn't see it at all during training
which is why i don't augment it)
